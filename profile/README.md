# About this project
The lack of nutritional awareness and food identification skills among individuals hinders their ability to make informed dietary choices, leading to health issues and contributing to food waste. Despite the cultural richness of Indonesian cuisine, many individuals, including both locals and tourists, struggle to recognize and understand the nutritional content of traditional dishes. This gap in knowledge not only impacts personal health but also undermines efforts towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-being) and Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).

Archipelago cuisine is a local identity because it has become part of the culture of the local community and is a characteristic of an area which becomes an added value when foreign tourists visit the area. However, it is often found that foreign tourists are still not familiar with existing Indonesian food, they cannot differentiate one dish from another. Apart from that, people are starting to realize how important it is to be consistent in living a healthy lifestyle, but this is not balanced with knowledge about the number of calories the body needs. 

As a result, the number of calories entering the body is often uncontrolled. Therefore, we are here with an application that can classify Indonesian cuisine, accompanied by information on the number of calories in the food. Apart from that, our application can also provide the nearest restaurant if you want to look for a particular Indonesian cuisine. So, this application can be used by foreign tourists and Indonesian people.
